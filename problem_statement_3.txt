## Problem Statement 3

- First of all, we should give Developer the access to the production environment. 
- Secondly, for production monitoring is must! We should have received an alert when the disk space usage crossed 80% 


# Steps to recover disk space
1. Run the below command
    apt-get autoremove

2. At times the above command does not run as "out of disk space" error occurs (current senario),
   in that case if possible find something that can be deleted. 

3. If you don't have anything to delete the purge linux headers which are older one
    uname -r (DON'T remove this kernel)
    apt-get purge linux-headers-x.x.x-x 

4. You can also use dpkg command to remove old kernels
    uname -r (DON'T remove this kernel)
    dpkg --list 'linux-image-*'
    apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x-x-generic
