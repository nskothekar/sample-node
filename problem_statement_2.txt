# Problem Statement 2

## Get Open file count
- Command to find PID
	ps -ef | grep -i weblogic

- Check number of open files for given process
	lsof -p <pid of weblogic> | wc -l


## Debugging steps
Root Cause: This when when JVM is unable to open any new file because of limit set by on linux server

## Analysis
- Switch to weblogic
	su - weblogicRu

- Check limit set on the server
	ulimit -n

## Solution
- Analyse the opened file from output of "lsof -p <pid_of_weblogic>".
- If a bug has resulted in opening large number of files, then fix the bug and redeploy the application.
- if no bug is found, consider increasing the open file limit.


## Increase open file limit for weblogicusr user
- Open /etc/security/limits.conf
- Add the below lines at the end;
	weblogicusr soft nofile <number_of_file>
	weblogicusr hard nofile <number_of_file>
